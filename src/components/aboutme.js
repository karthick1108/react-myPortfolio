          Hello Everyone, <br /> <br />
          Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Karthick and I recently graduated
          from Monash University with a Master's Degree in IT. I am an
          accomplished programmer, and I enjoy using my skills to contribute to
          the exciting technological advances that happen every day. My desire
          to undertake Computing systems as a career began with pursuing a
          Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. It was during
          this period that I was able to appreciate the core concepts of
          Computer Science like Compilers, Operating Systems, Database Systems,
          Computer Networks etc. Post my Bachelor’s degree, I obtained an
          opportunity to start my professional career working with Tata
          Consultancy Services for 3 years. I am currently working on enhancing
          my technical skills by learning new frameworks like Node, MERN Stack,
          Flutter and React. I am a sort of person who believes that attitude
          comes before aptitude. As I'm young and learning in this industry, I'm
          always on lookout for new challenges and I'm completely flexible to
          put on different hats according to the situation. Some roles I am open
          to include Software Developer, Full Stack Web Developer, Android
          Developer and Big Data Developer. It would be an absolute pleasure to
          connect with you{" "}
